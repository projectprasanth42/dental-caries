In our analysis of the latest 500 panoramic dental images, we found a total of 497 photos that were adequately labeled by medical professionals, with 3 photos (numbers 194, 256, and 436) remaining unlabeled. Among these, signs of dental issues were identified in 510 cases: 51 instances of superficial caries, 102 of medium caries, 153 of pulpitis, 204 of deep caries, and an additional 255 cases identified through the original labels provided by the doctors.

Upon cleaning the data from these 1460 images, we refined the dataset to include 493 images, excluding four that were initially suspected but not confirmed. The cleaned data, labeled as 'colors_clean', presents a simplified categorization into three types of caries: 102 superficial, 153 medium, and 255 deep caries.

The 'label_clean' dataset specifically corresponds to the extremes of this range, focusing on images identified with superficial (0) and deep (255) caries.

Unfortunately, we were unable to restore the data for the last 500 images due to the absence of corresponding record locations, limiting our analysis and intervention efforts.
